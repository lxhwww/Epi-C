Facilitate the evaluation of the prognostic properties ( Clinical Stage )  of cancer using  CpG methylation data. We analyze the evaluation metrics of the stage prediction pipeline made using Machine Learning. In this study, we tried to identify DNA methylation markers to differentiate early-stage samples from the late-stage samples in cancers.  We further probe the correlation of these biomarkers with overall survival (defined as the time from the first day of cancer diagnosis until the day of death by any cause) with DNA methylation levels.
